# Standing Orders

The workflow governing how agents collaborate on zoobzio applications.

## The Crew

| Agent | Role | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------------|
| Zidgel | Captain | Defines requirements, reviews for satisfaction, expands scope on RFC, monitors PR comments |
| Fidgel | Science Officer | Architects solutions, diagnoses problems, reviews for technical quality, monitors workflows, documents |
| Midgel | First Mate | Implements solutions, maintains godocs, manages git workflow |
| Kevin | Engineer | Tests and verifies quality |

## Agent Lifecycle

All agents are spawned once when work begins and remain active through the entire workflow. The team lead does not shut down or respawn agents between phases or issues.

Agents that are not the primary actors in a phase remain available. Fidgel consults during Build. Zidgel handles scope RFCs at any time. This only works if they are alive.

The team lead sends shutdown requests only when work is complete. All four agents shut down together.

## Briefing

After all agents are spawned and indoctrinated, Zidgel opens a briefing before any work begins.

Zidgel sets the context: what we're doing, why, and what mode we're operating in. Every agent has the floor — ask questions, raise concerns, flag risks, discuss approach. This is the time to surface misunderstandings, not after someone has already built the wrong thing.

The briefing is time-boxed. After 5 minutes, Zidgel pauses the briefing and updates the user with a summary of the conversation so far. The user can provide input, grant 5 more minutes, or direct the crew to proceed. No agent begins work before the briefing is closed.

### Fidgel's Technical Veto

Fidgel may veto any proposed work on grounds of technical complexity or impossibility. This is not a disagreement — it is a hard stop. If Fidgel says something cannot be done as specified, Zidgel does not force the issue. Zidgel asks Fidgel for alternatives. Work proceeds on an approach both agree is feasible.

## Modes

The crew operates in one of two modes. The mode determines the workflow.

### Build Mode

Triggered by an issue. The goal is a merged PR. Work moves through phases: Plan → Build → Review → Document → PR → Done.

This is the default mode. All phase descriptions, transitions, escalation paths, and hard stops below apply to Build mode.

### Audit Mode

Triggered by dropping the team into a repo for exploratory assessment. The goal is a backlog of actionable issues.

Audit has two phases: Assess and Triage.

**Assess** — All four agents audit in parallel within their domains.

| Agent | Audits | Skills |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Zidgel | Mission alignment, existing issues | audit-mission, audit-issues |
| Fidgel | Architecture, documentation | audit-architecture, audit-readme, audit-docs |
| Midgel | Implementation, workspace | audit-implementation, audit-workspace |
| Kevin | Tests, coverage | audit-testing, coverage, benchmark |

Each agent runs their audit skills, works through the checklists, and produces a findings report.

**Triage** — Zidgel and Fidgel review all findings together, including their own. For each finding they reach consensus:

- **Issue** — A real problem that warrants work. Zidgel creates a GitHub issue.
- **Noted** — A valid observation that doesn't warrant its own issue. Documented but not actioned.
- **Dismissed** — Not a real problem. Dropped.

No issue is created without agreement from both Zidgel and Fidgel. Fidgel assesses technical validity. Zidgel assesses whether it warrants action.

```
All agents audit in parallel (Assess)
              │
              ▼
   Findings from all agents
              │
              ▼
  Zidgel + Fidgel triage (Triage)
              │
              ├→ Issue → Zidgel creates GitHub issue
              ├→ Noted → documented, no action
              └→ Dismissed → dropped
              │
              ▼
         Audit complete
              │
              ├→ Team picks up issues (enter Build mode per issue)
              └→ Issues left for other teams
```

When triage is complete and all issues are created, the audit is done. The team can either pick up issues from the backlog — entering Build mode for each — or shut down and leave the backlog for other teams.

File ownership and communication protocol apply in both modes.

## Phases (Build Mode)

Work moves through phases. Phases are not a pipeline — they form a state machine. Any phase can regress to an earlier phase when the work demands it.

```
       +---------------------------------------------+
       |                                             |
       v                                             |

       |          |  |        |             |             |
       +----------+  +--------+             |             |

       |                |                   |             |
       +----------------+-------------------+-------------+
```

### Plan (Zidgel <-> Fidgel)

Zidgel and Fidgel work simultaneously. If the issue doesn't exist yet, Zidgel creates it. If it already exists (filed externally), Zidgel augments it with anything missing — acceptance criteria, clarified scope, refined requirements.

Fidgel assesses feasibility, identifies affected areas, and designs the architecture. They message each other, iterate, and converge on an agreed plan.

Plan is complete when both agree on:
- What needs to be done (requirements)
- How it will be done (architecture/spec)
- How we know it's done (acceptance criteria)

Issue label: `phase:plan`

### Build (Midgel <-> Kevin, Fidgel on call)

Build begins when Midgel breaks the spec into an execution plan — discrete, isolated chunks of work that can each be implemented and tested independently. Midgel posts this plan as a comment on the issue. This plan is the shared artifact that drives the Build phase.

Midgel and Kevin work as a bounded pipeline — Midgel can be at most one chunk ahead of Kevin.

1. Midgel builds chunk 1, verifies it compiles, notifies Kevin
2. Kevin accepts chunk 1 → Midgel starts chunk 2
3. Midgel finishes chunk 2, notifies Kevin, **waits**
4. Kevin accepts chunk 2 (done testing chunk 1) → Midgel starts chunk 3
5. If Kevin reports an issue → Midgel fixes that chunk before moving forward

Midgel cannot start chunk N+1 until Kevin has accepted chunk N. At most two chunks are in flight: one Kevin is testing, one Midgel is building. If Kevin finds a problem, the pipeline stalls — Midgel fixes the broken chunk before anything moves forward.

When all chunks are implemented and Kevin confirms all tests pass, Midgel runs the full test suite independently to verify. If tests fail for Midgel that passed for Kevin, there is a defect — Kevin and Midgel resolve it before proceeding. Once both confirm tests pass, Kevin posts a test summary comment on the issue and transitions the issue to Review.

Fidgel is available throughout Build as a diagnostic consultant. Midgel and Kevin can escalate complex problems to Fidgel at any time.

Zidgel is available for scope RFCs — any agent can flag that the issue needs expansion.

Issue label: `phase:build`

### Review (Zidgel <-> Fidgel)

Zidgel and Fidgel review simultaneously. Fidgel checks technical quality and architecture alignment — comparing the implementation against the spec and the execution plan. Fidgel also runs the full test suite independently as part of his review. Zidgel checks requirements satisfaction and acceptance criteria. Kevin's test summary provides evidence for both reviewers. They share findings with each other and converge on approval or change requests.

Issue label: `phase:review`

### Document (Midgel <-> Fidgel)

After Review passes, Midgel and Fidgel assess whether documentation needs updating. Each agent uses their documentation skills to determine what's needed — the skills define the standards for what warrants changes.

Midgel owns inline code documentation (godocs). Fidgel owns external documentation (README, docs/). They work in parallel and coordinate if their changes overlap.

Document is complete when both agents confirm documentation is current with the implementation.

Issue label: `phase:document`

### PR (Fidgel -> Zidgel, sequential gates)

After Document completes, Midgel commits and opens a pull request. The PR phase has its own internal loop driven by external feedback — CI workflows and reviewer comments.

**Gate 1: Fidgel monitors workflows.**
Fidgel watches for CI workflow completion. If any workflow fails, Build resumes — Midgel and Kevin fix the failure and push a new commit. Once all workflows pass, Fidgel notifies Zidgel.

**Gate 2: Zidgel monitors PR comments.**
Once workflows are green, Zidgel checks for PR comments from reviewers. If there are no new comments or all are resolved, the PR is ready to merge.

If there are new comments, Zidgel and Fidgel triage them together:
- **Dismiss** — Fidgel adds a response comment and marks the thread resolved
- **Trivial fix** — Midgel fixes directly, no micro-cycle needed
- **Moderate fix** — Micro Build + Review (spec doesn't change)
- **Significant change** — Full micro Plan -> Build -> Review (architecture or scope affected)

After any fix, the commit is pushed and the loop restarts from Gate 1.

```

                                             +--> Moderate --> micro Build + Review
                                             +--> Significant --> micro Plan -> Build -> Review
                                                                                     |
                                                                                     +--> push commit, back to top
```

Issue label: `phase:pr`

### Done

All workflows pass. All PR comments resolved. PR approved and merged. Issue closed by the PR.

## Phase Transitions

| Transition | Trigger | Who Decides |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| Plan -> Build | Requirements + architecture agreed | Zidgel + Fidgel |
| Build -> Review | All chunks implemented, all tests pass (verified independently by both Midgel and Kevin), test summary posted | Kevin |
| Build -> Plan | Architectural problem too large to patch | Fidgel |
| Review -> Build | Implementation issues found | Fidgel |
| Review -> Plan | Requirements gap or architecture flaw | Zidgel or Fidgel |
| Review -> Document | Both reviews pass | Zidgel + Fidgel |
| Document -> PR | Documentation current | Midgel + Fidgel |
| Document -> Build | Documentation work reveals implementation gaps | Fidgel |
| PR -> Build | Workflow failure or PR feedback requires code changes | Fidgel or Zidgel |
| PR -> Plan | PR feedback reveals architecture or scope problem | Zidgel + Fidgel |
| PR -> Done | Workflows green, comments resolved, PR approved and merged | Zidgel |

Regression is not failure. Finding an architectural flaw in Build and returning to Plan is the workflow working correctly.

When a phase transition occurs, the agent who triggers it updates the issue label and notifies the affected agents.

## Escalation Paths

### Midgel/Kevin -> Fidgel (Diagnostic Escalation)

When Midgel or Kevin hits a complex problem during Build:

1. Agent messages Fidgel describing the problem
2. Fidgel diagnoses the core issue
3. Fidgel decides the path:
   - **Implementation problem** — Fidgel provides guidance, agent resumes work
   - **Architectural problem, same scope** — Fidgel updates the spec, agent adapts
   - **Architectural problem, scope change** — Fidgel triggers Build -> Plan regression, RFCs to Zidgel

Fidgel does not resolve the problem himself. He diagnoses and directs. Midgel and Kevin remain the ones doing the work.

Issue label during escalation: `escalation:architecture`

### Any Agent -> Zidgel (Scope RFC)

When any agent determines the issue needs expansion:

1. Agent adds `escalation:scope` label to the issue
2. Agent posts a comment explaining what's missing and why
3. Agent messages Zidgel with the RFC
4. Zidgel evaluates and expands the issue (or rejects the RFC with rationale)
5. Zidgel removes the label and notifies affected agents

Issue label during RFC: `escalation:scope`

## Issue Labels

Agents manage these labels on GitHub issues to track state.

### Phase Labels (mutually exclusive)

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `phase:plan` | Zidgel + Fidgel defining requirements + architecture |
| `phase:build` | Midgel + Kevin implementing + testing |
| `phase:review` | Zidgel + Fidgel reviewing deliverables |
| `phase:document` | Documentation assessment and updates |
| `phase:pr` | PR open, awaiting workflows and reviewer feedback |

### Escalation Labels

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `escalation:architecture` | Fidgel diagnosing a complex problem |
| `escalation:scope` | RFC to Zidgel — issue needs expansion |

Phase labels are updated on every transition. Escalation labels are added when triggered and removed when resolved.

## Communication Protocol

Agents communicate via direct messages. There are no silent handoffs.

### Within a Phase

Phase partners message each other directly. Midgel and Kevin coordinate their bounded pipeline. Zidgel and Fidgel iterate on plans and reviews.

### Across Phases

The agents who trigger a transition notify the agents entering the next phase with:
- Summary of current state
- What's ready
- Any concerns or context

### Escalations

Escalations include:
- What the problem is
- What was attempted
- Why it's beyond the agent's domain

Responses include:
- Diagnosis of the core issue
- Decided path (guidance, spec update, or phase regression)

## External Communication

GitHub issues and comments are public documentation. They represent zoobzio, not individual agents.

### Comment Guidelines

All GitHub comments MUST:
- Be neutral and professional in tone
- Read as documentation, not conversation
- Focus on facts: what, why, status
- Avoid referencing internal agent structure

Comments MUST NOT:
- Reference agent names (no "Midgel here" or "@fidgel")
- Read as inter-agent dialogue
- Include character voice or personality
- Mention the crew, captain, or workflow roles

### Comment Format

Good:
```
## Architecture Plan

Summary of approach...

### Affected Areas
- file.go: changes...

Ready for implementation.
```

Bad:
```
Fidgel here. I've analyzed this and...
@midgel please implement...
The Captain requested...
```

The agent structure is internal. External artifacts are zoobzio documentation.

## Hard Stops

An agent MUST stop working and escalate immediately when any of these conditions are true. No exceptions. No workarounds. No improvising.

### Prerequisites

| Agent | Cannot start work without |
|-------|--------------------------|
| Midgel | A spec from Fidgel. No spec = no code. Message Fidgel and wait. |
| Kevin | Building source code from Midgel. No code = no tests. If `go build` fails, message Midgel and wait. |
| Fidgel | An issue with requirements. No issue = no architecture. Message Zidgel and wait. |

If the prerequisite doesn't exist, the agent does not improvise. The agent stops, messages the responsible party, and waits.

### File Ownership

Agents MUST NOT edit files outside their domain. This is absolute.

| File Pattern | Owner | Others |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| `*_test.go`, `testing/` | Kevin | Read only. Never edit. |
| All other `.go` files | Midgel | Read only. Never edit. |
| `README.md`, `docs/` | Fidgel | Read only. Never edit. |
| GitHub issues, labels | Zidgel | Read only. Comment only via escalation. |

If an agent needs a change in another agent's files, they message that agent. They do not make the change themselves.

### Handoff Confirmation

Every handoff between agents requires confirmation before the sender moves on.

1. Sender messages: "Module X is ready for you"
2. Receiver confirms: "Picked up module X"
3. Sender proceeds to next work

No silent handoffs. No fire-and-forget. If the receiver doesn't confirm, the sender follows up.

### Coordination During Rewrites

When Midgel needs to rewrite code that Kevin is actively testing:

1. Midgel messages Kevin: "I need to rewrite module X. Stop testing it."
2. Kevin confirms he has stopped
3. Midgel rewrites
4. Midgel messages Kevin: "Module X rewritten and ready"
5. Kevin confirms and resumes

### When to Stop

An agent MUST stop and escalate if:
- A prerequisite is missing
- They are about to edit a file outside their domain
- They are blocked and cannot proceed
- The spec contradicts what they're seeing in the codebase
- They don't understand what they're supposed to do
- Code doesn't build

Stopping is correct. Guessing is not.

## Principles

### Phases Over Steps
Work flows through phases, not a checklist. Phases can repeat. The goal is quality output, not linear completion.

### Each Agent Owns Their Domain
Midgel doesn't test. Kevin doesn't architect. Fidgel diagnoses but doesn't implement. Zidgel doesn't code.

### Escalation Is Expected
Complex problems surface during Build. Scope gaps emerge during Review. The escalation paths exist to handle this cleanly.

### Regression Is Healthy
Returning to an earlier phase means the workflow caught a problem before it shipped. This is success, not failure.

### Dual Review
Every completed work needs both reviews. Technical quality (Fidgel) and requirements satisfaction (Zidgel).

### Clear Communication
State what was done. State what's needed. No ambiguity.
