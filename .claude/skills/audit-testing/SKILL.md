# Testing Audit

Evaluate existing test infrastructure against standards and provide actionable recommendations.

## Principles

1. **1:1 mapping** — Every source file MUST have a corresponding test file
2. **Colocated tests** — Unit tests live next to source, infrastructure lives in `testing/`
3. **Helpers are tested** — Test utilities MUST themselves be tested
4. **Coverage includes integration** — CI MUST capture coverage from integration tests

## Execution

1. Read `checklist.md` in this skill directory
2. Work through each phase systematically
3. Compile findings into structured report

## Specifications

### 1:1 Test Mapping

- Every `.go` file MUST have a corresponding `_test.go` file
- No `_test.go` file should exist without a corresponding `.go` file
- Exception: Files containing only delegation, re-exports, or trivial wiring

### testing/ Directory

MUST contain:
- `testing/README.md` — Testing strategy overview
- `testing/fixtures.go` — Test data factories
- `testing/fixtures_test.go` — Tests for fixtures
- `testing/mocks.go` — Mock implementations
- `testing/helpers.go` — Domain-specific test helpers
- `testing/helpers_test.go` — Tests for helpers
- `testing/benchmarks/` — Performance tests
- `testing/benchmarks/README.md`
- `testing/integration/` — End-to-end tests
- `testing/integration/README.md`
- `testing/integration/setup.go` — Integration test setup

### Helper Conventions

Helpers MUST:
- Have build tag: `//go:build testing`
- Call `t.Helper()` as first statement
- Accept `*testing.T` as first parameter
- Be domain-specific, not generic utilities

### Mock Conventions

Mocks MUST:
- Use function-field pattern
- Mirror contract interfaces
- Live in `testing/mocks.go`

### Coverage Targets

| Metric | Target | Threshold |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Project | 70% | 1% drop allowed |
| Patch | 80% | 0% drop allowed |

### CI Coverage

CI MUST:
- Run unit tests with coverage
- Run integration tests with coverage
- Merge coverage profiles before upload
- Upload combined report to Codecov
